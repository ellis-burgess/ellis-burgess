- 👋 Hi, I’m @ellis-burgess
- 👀 I’m interested in classical music, literature, coffee
- 🌱 I’m currently undertaking a conversion course in Computing at Cardiff University
  - (I dare you to try saying "conversion course in Computing at Cardiff" three times quickly!)
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to having a portfolio I'm proud of!
